/******************************************************************************
 *
 * FUNCTION:    AcpiOsGetRootPointer
 *
 * PARAMETERS:  None
 *
 * RETURN:      RSDP physical address
 *
 * DESCRIPTION: The ACPI specification is highly portable specification, however, 
 * it has a static part which is generally non-portable: the location of the Root System Descriptor Pointer. 
 * This pointer may be found in many different ways depending on the chipset. 
 * On PC-compatible computers (without EFI) it is located in lower memory generally 
 * somewhere between 0x80000 and 0x100000. However, even within the PC compatible platform, 
 * an EFI-enabled board will export the RSDP to the OS on when it loads it through the EFI system tables. 
 * Other boards on server machines which are not PC-compatibles, 
 * like embedded and handheld devices which implement ACPI will again, 
 * not all be expected to position the RSDP in the same place as any other board. 
 * The RSDP is therefore located in a chipset-specific manner; From the time the OS has the RSDP, 
 * the rest of ACPI is completely portable. However, the way the RSDP is found is not. 
 * This would be the reason that the ACPICA code wouldn't try to provide routines to expressly find the RSDP in a portable manner.
